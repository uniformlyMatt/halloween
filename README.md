# The Hands-Free Candy Dispenser - Halloween 2020

An overly complicated project for an overly complicated year, the hands-free candy dispenser is for the trick-or-treaters in my neighborhood. This repo holds all the code for the project. All of the code is written in Python 3+ and is intended for use with the Raspberry Pi GPIO.
Happy Halloween!
